See something you really enjoyed? See something you struggled with? See something you forgot we even covered?

Choose one area you want to refresh or further explore, look online for some interesting or challenging problems in that space, choose one and write a solution for it. You should also create a test file to make sure your code works with at least 3 tests in it. Refer to the previous homeworks for and example of how to make tests and test cases.

For this one, you will be more on your own as far as NINJA help goes, so choose your problem and proceed with caution.
