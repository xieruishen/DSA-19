# Dynamic Programming - Day02

**This assignment is due Thursday night, May 2nd. Since this is our last class, you cannot turn it in late. If you need more time to complete this, you can reach out to Paul to ask for an extension.**

## Learning Goals
- Practice dynamic programming problem solving steps
- Learn to identify and design a DP solution for more difficult problems
or
- Review or extend understanding on previous assignments

## Resources

- Walkthrough of the weighted interval problem from class today: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr6Ip0J9izc
- Erik Demaine's lecture on text justification: https://youtu.be/ENyox7kNKeY
- The DP implementation PDF we handed out at the start of the unit: https://drive.google.com/open?id=156zlHrsjV72xLNYHfVyOoGE99XNZomVu

## Assignment
Choose **one** of the three options below. use the corresponding folder to the option you choose. Do not expect NINJAs help with your code on options 1 or 3.

#### Option 1: Super Hard Problem --------*Worth 3 Late Days!!!*
Implement a solution to an interview question a previous instructor was asked that only 1 out of ~80 interviewees was able to get in time. Also, it is not googlable (at least we couldn't find an answer online). Your answer must run in **polynomial** time (n, n^2, n^3 etc.). Not N! or some constant C^N. Bonus points if you come up with a solution different than ours.

Reach out to Nick to get checked off for it.

#### Option 2: Two decently hard problems
This is the original option from last year, and the one the NINJAs can help best with. You choose **2** out of 3 hard DP problems to solve. Again, your answers must run in polynomial time (n, n^2, n^3 etc.). Not N! or some constant C^N.

#### Option 3: Personal Exploration
Look into a topic that we have covered that either you feel hazy about or that you  are interested in looking deeper into. Do some research online and find an interesting problem relating to it. Write an appropriate solution to that problem **and** test cases to test your solution.
